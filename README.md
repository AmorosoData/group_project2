GDP and Nukes


For this project, the team is exploring the question whether there is a relationship between a country’s GDP and the size of a country’s nuclear weapons arsenal. 

The data we will be examining comes from the [Federation of American Scientists published by Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons). 

[Country GDP](https://knoema.com/mhrzolg/historical-gdp-by-country-statistics-from-the-world-bank-1960-2018).

In order to tell our story, we will be exploring a variety of visualizations that may include:

- Dynamic map visualizations to show quantities of weapons by country
- Line charts to show changes in individual country’s economic health and munitions over time.
- Heat maps. 



In addition, we will also be exploring various [happiness indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). Doing this to examine other relationships between nuclear stockpiles and GDP

 Other indicators to be explored (if needed) include: the Human Development Index (HDI), Gross National Income (GNI), and [National Suicide Rates](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016).
