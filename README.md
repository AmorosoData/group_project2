GDP and Nukes


For this project, the team is exploring the question whether there is a relationship between a country’s GDP and the size of a country’s nuclear weapons arsenal. 

The data we will be examining comes from the Federation of American Scientists published by Our World in Data. 

In order to tell our story, we will be exploring a variety of visualizations that may include:

- Dynamic map visualizations to show quantities of weapons by country
- Line charts to show changes in individual country’s economic health and munitions over time.
- Heat maps. 

In addition, we will also be exploring various [happiness indicators](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). Doing this to examine other relationships between nuclear stockpiles and GDP

 Other indicators to be explored (if needed) include: the Human Development Index (HDI), Gross National Income (GNI), and National Suicide Rates.
